title: Lets Mob the shit out of that interface - Frontend and UX Dev Mobbing
author: Charl Kruger

Being a developer of any kind can be a lonely place from my experience. For most of the day it's just you and your terminal - zoned in, head phones on and hacking away at the keyboard. Then when in doubt or things break - Google it, search on Stack Overflow and reading up on documentation.

After I have exhausted all options on my 'own' and just before I am about to give up would I reach out to another dev within the company.

The other day our software coach / agile consultant, Martin Cronje came in glowing with some new approach.

Taking a step back and thinking about my progression over the years, everything I have learnt, I have learnt from other people. Wait, what! Yip, that's the interwebs, other people contributions.
