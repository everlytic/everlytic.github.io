Being a developer of any kind can be a lonely place from my experience. For most of the day it's just my terminal
, head phones on, zoned-in and hacking away at the keyboard. Then I'm unsure of something or things break and turn to good old Google.
Only after I have exhausted all results on page one and five different search phrases on my 'own', just before I am about to give up would I reach out
to another dev within the company.

Our software coach / agile consultant, Martin Cronje had just come back from some "amazing" conference and went on about
 mob programming which led me to take a step back and look at my progression over the years. I came to a really interesting
 realization. Everything I have learnt, I have learnt from other people. I owe my expertise to the internet - other peoples contributions.

Yes, I have had great mentors and co-workers though the majority of my learning was due to me taking the owenes and searching online for a solution.
If I am surrounded by other devs whom are more likely to have encountered a related or vaguely similar problem given that our environment is highly unique,
maybe I've been approaching the issue in a reverse order all this time. Welcome to mob programming.

###Mob Programming take one

Our first mob comprised of four back-end devs, two frontend devs and a UX designer. We mobbed the story map and decided to break-out
into a frontend and backend mob and would later merge our changes with everything syncing perfectly.. lol'd.

I was part of the frontend mob and we got started by wire-framing how we though the interface should work
